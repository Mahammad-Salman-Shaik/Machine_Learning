# Machine Learning Projects

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects that demonstrate various techniques and applications of predictive modeling, data analysis, and machine learning algorithms. The projects span a range of topics, from classification and regression problems to more advanced applications like natural language processing and time series forecasting.

The goal of this repository is to showcase practical applications of machine learning using real-world datasets and to highlight the technical skills used in data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

## Key Features
- **Comprehensive Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, feature engineering, and normalization/standardization techniques.
- **Diverse Algorithms**: Implement a variety of machine learning algorithms including decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, k-nearest neighbors, and deep learning techniques.
- **Model Evaluation**: Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices to evaluate model performance.
- **Visualization**: Data visualizations using libraries like `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to uncover trends and insights in the data.

## Projects
- **Churn Prediction**: Predict customer churn for a telecom company using classification models. Includes data preprocessing, EDA, and handling class imbalance.
- **Oil Production Forecasting**: Forecast oil production using machine learning models based on time series data from the Volve oil field.


## Tech Stack
- **Python**: Core programming language used for data manipulation, model building, and visualization.
- **Libraries**: 
  - `pandas` and `numpy` for data manipulation.
  - `scikit-learn` for model building and evaluation.
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization.
  - `TensorFlow` and `Keras` for deep learning.
  - `nltk` and `spacy` for natural language processing.

## How to Run the Projects
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/machine-learning-branch.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Explore the individual project directories and open the Jupyter notebooks to run the code:
   ```
   jupyter notebook project_name.ipynb
   ```

## Future Enhancements
- **Advanced Algorithms**: Experiment with more complex models such as XGBoost, LightGBM, and neural networks for better performance.
- **Model Deployment**: Deploy models as web applications using `Flask` or `Streamlit` for real-time predictions.
- **Data Augmentation**: Use data augmentation techniques to improve model generalization, especially in image and text-related projects.
